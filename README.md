# sci-scraper
This project aims to provide an automated search on scientific databases. Is is already in use, but not exactly in this published form.
We hope, with this published version, to provide an easy enough way to reproduce its execution, giving the same results, and in the future unify the "production version" here.

## How to get it working
For now it is required some programming experience in Python. We still depend on selenium, geckodriver, Mozilla Firefox browser installed for some of the scraping work.
Future goal is to provide a way to run it thru google colab or similar "paste and run" solutions.
There is no friendly environment tool inplace for now, so please check the packages in use, and track the errors if required be.
Also note that this code, for now, is only expected to run in a MS Windows OS.
